Letters but Physics

This project is a physics-based animation where letters drop and interact with the environment using the Matter.js physics engine.
Features

    Drop Letters: Type text and drop letters that have physical properties.
    Reset Letters: Remove all dropped letters from the simulation.
    Toggle Hitboxes: Show or hide the hitboxes around the letters.
    Pause/Resume Simulation: Temporarily halt and resume the physics simulation.
    Click Interaction: Apply an outward force in a circular shape anywhere on the screen by clicking.
    Customizable Commands: Automated commands with anti-bot verification to manage purchases and upgrades.

Setup and Usage
Ensure you have Node.js installed.
Navigate to the project folder:

cd /D:/VS_code/React_maybe_idk/Letter_physics

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the development server:

npm start

Project Structure

    src/app.js: Main application file handling the simulation, user input, and interactions.
    src/index.js: Entry point for the React application.
    src/index.html: Basic HTML template including styles to match the simulation background.

Enjoy the simulation and experiment with interactive physics for letters!
